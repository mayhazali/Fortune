# Fortune
Java/Swing application

# Inspiration
I enjoyed reading through the Replit Creates prompts and was inspired by the community projects on Replit. I decided to use the "Tell someone their fortune" prompt to create a simple application that predicts users' fortune based on the sequence of numbers selected by them. To keep it interesting and mysterious, the same numbers selected a second time do not result in similar predictions.

# Challenges I ran into
Initially, I chose the Java template in Replit, and my code did not compile. Later I realized that Replit has a separate Java (Swing) template for projects that use the Swing toolkit. Once I chose the correct template, my project worked! I am grateful to Replit for making it so easy to develop, publish and share Java(Swing) projects.

# What I learned
I learned to use the Java Swing Graphical User Interface widget toolkit while building a fun Fortune Teller game.

# What's next
In the future, I plan to try out other available Replit templates to learn to code using different programming languages, libraries and toolkits without having to worry about installing and setting up my local IDE.

I would also like to build on top of some very interesting projects I found on the Replit community!
